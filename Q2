## Mentor Hints for Week 2 Graded Quiz

Data sets
a. Salary Data Set

b. Dognition data

Question 1
Consider whether there are other ways to aggregate the variable you are examining that would be more 
appropriate for answering this question.

# Tableau

Question 2
The “View Data” function in the Tableau workspace might be helpful for answering this question.

# Steps:
1.Filter out the outliers in Dog ID (those with sign-in counts greater than 175). 
2. Place State in the Filter and display on "37".
3. Right-click on "11" and select "View Data". When the dialog box pops up, select "Full Data" at the bottom.
4. Immediately, you can select "They are all from Estonia", exclude "They are all golden retrievers" and "They are all charmers".
5. Scroll to the right till you see "Total Test Completed" and "Weight". You will see that "They all completed 37 tests" 
and "They all weight 37 pounds" should be excluded as well.

Question 3
The “View Data” function in the Tableau workspace might be helpful for answering this question.

Question 4
Make sure you have filtered out the group of dogs whose data we know is not real (see Exercise 1) 
and double-check that the type of aggregation you are using in your analysis is appropriate.

Question 5
Make sure the type of aggregation you are using in your analysis is appropriate.

Question 6
Please review Lesson 3 Let's Get Started to review how to arrive at the correct answer.

Question 7
Please review Lesson 3 Let's Get Started to review how to arrive at the correct answer.

Question 8
Please check that you are using the appropriate aggregation, and review Lesson 3
Let's Get Started and the course Practice Exercises for information about how to arrive at the correct answer.

# Variables & Filters:
There are three variables we are interested in: Dog Fixed, Breed Type and Average Number of Test Completed.
Filters: Dog ID( Group) Other

# Summary: 
There are three variables we are interested in: Dog Fixed, Breed Type and Average Number of Test Completed.

# Some immediate observations:
1. On average, fixed dogs completed more tests than non-fixed dogs on all breed types. All the bars in fixed dog category 
(1) are higher than in the non-fixed category (0)
2. The greatest difference is between the Mixed Breed/Other/I don't Know.

These are the only choices in the answer that are supported by data.

Question 9
Please review Lesson 3 Let's Get Started to review how to arrive at the correct answer.
# Summary: 
In addition to the three variables in Q8, there is an additional variable we are also interested in: DNA Tested. Add "DNA Tested" 
to the Column shelf in the order shown. Place the variables in this order will make analyzing the answer choices in Q9 
more straight forward.

# Steps:
Filter out the outliers in Dog ID (those with Sign-In Count greater than 175), since those accounts were created to test the system 
(it was mentioned in page 2 of the exercise PDF file).

# Analysis:
Answer choice: "The Cross-Breed dogs that were DNA tested but NOT fixed were mostly Labrador Retriever-Golden Retriever Mixes".
--->In the block for DNA tested but not fixed, the 3rd block from the left, right-click on the bar for Cross Breed, click on 
View Data and select Full Data at the bottom. You can immediately tell that the dogs in this category are mostly
Labrador Retriever-Golden Retriever Mixes.

Answer choice: "The Cross-Breed dogs that were DNA tested but NOT fixed were mostly Golden Doodles."
--->No. Because of the analysis above, this should be immediately excluded.

Answer choice: "There was only one dog in the Popular Hybrid breed category who was DNA tested but not fixed."
--> DNA tested but not fixed. So the 3rd block from the left in the graph. Right click on the bar for Popular Hybrid, click on View 
Data and click Full Data at the bottom of the dialog box. You see that there is only one entry in the full data. So, the above 
statement is correct and should be selected.

Answer choice: "DNA-tested dogs completed more tests than dogs that were NOT DNA tested in all categories except for the category of 
Popular Hybrids who were fixed."
-->Take "Dog Fixed" off the Columns shelf. You can immediately tell that except for Popular Hybrids, DNA tested dogs completed more
tests than dogs that are not DNA tested. Hence, the above statement should be selected.

Answer choice: "DNA-tested dogs completed less tests than dogs that were NOT DNA tested in all categories except for the category 
of Popular Hybrids who were fixed."
--> Because of the analysis above, this statement is false and should not be selected.

Question 10
Check your filters, and make sure your aggregations are appropriate. 
See Practice Exercise 4 for more information about how to make the graph.

Question 11
Make sure your aggregations are appropriate, and remember that you can hover over the state to see 
the precise number of records in the tool tip.

Question 13
Please review video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2q-L3auqW8

Question 14
Refer to Lesson 6 Line Graphs and Box Plots to review how to answer this type of question.

"There was a significant positive (p < .05) correlation between average ITIs and number of tests completed."
--> To test the truthfulness of the above statement, do the following: Place Mean ITI (Minutes) in the Columns shelf and place 
Total Test Completed in the Rows shelf. The default function will be Sum. Whatever used for Mean ITI, the independent variable, 
the same function should be used for the dependent variable Total Test Completed. Disaggregate the data by going to Analysis tab and 
un-check Aggregate Measures.

Group the Sign-In Count outliers by Dog ID (those with sign-in count greater than 175) Place Dog ID (Group) in the Filter and 
display Other.

Place Mean ITI (Minutes) in the Filter and display only values are 150K or less to filter out the outliers. 
(Drag the variable to Filter: "#All" --> At Most --> 150,000)

Place Total Test Completed display only values that are less than or equal to 19. 
(Drag the variable to the Filter: "#All", --> At Most -->19)

Right-click and select "Show Trend Lines...". You can immediately tell that the correlation between the Mean ITI (Minutes) and 
Number of Test Completed is positive, because the line has an up-ward slope. To find the p-value, point the cursor at the line. 
p-value<0.0001, which is smaller than 0.5, so the correlation is significant at the 95% confidence interval by the p-value approach.

So, the statement is true.

"There was a significant negative (p < .05) correlation between median ITIs and number of tests completed."
To test the truthfulness of this statement, take Mean ITI out of the Columns shelf and put Median ITI (Minutes) there. Take Mean ITI 
(minutes) out of the Filter and put Median ITI (Minutes) there. Display only values below 150K as previously did with the Mean.

Right-click and select "Show Trend Line...". You can immediately tell that the correlation is negative, because of the line is down-ward
sloping line. Point the cursor the line to display the p-value. p-value <0.0001, below 5%, hence, the correlation is significant 
at 95% confidence interval, by the p-value approach.

The above are the only two correct statements in Q14's answer choices. Indeed, once you select the above two statements, the others are
automatically false, since they contradict the above two statements.

To answer Francesco Racanati's question "why are we talking of "significant correlation" if we are getting so lower values of R^2?", 
a low R-square and a significant p-value, this is what happens why you force a regression on two variables while the independent variable
bears little predictive effect on the dependent variable. Using the Median ITI (Minute) vs. Total Test Completed as an example, 
the R-square is only 0.0084051 while the p-value is statistically significant. Only 0.8% change in dependent variable 
"Total Test Completed" is explained by the independent variable "Median ITI (Minutes)".

Low R-squared could also happen when statistically insignificant independent variables are included with significant independent 
variables in the model. But in the case of Q14, there is only one independent variable, Mean ITI or Median ITI. Hence, we can conclude 
that Mean ITI or Median ITI have little or no predictive effect on the dependent variable "Total Tests Completed".


Question 15
Refer to Lesson 6 Line Graphs and Box Plots to review how to answer this type of question.
--> Use the same approach as above, except that change the filter on Total Test Completed to 7.
