# Robust explanations for the graded quiz, with all the fine details you want without giving out the answer.
For all questions, filter out the test accounts: the Shih Tzu that weigh more than 190 pounds. If you do not, the presence of these 
tests accounts will likely make your analysis inaccurate.
Right-click while in the Measure pane or go to Analysis. Choose Create Calculated Filed...

**You may use the following function.**
IF[Breed]="Shih Tzu"
AND[Weight]=190
THEN "Exclude"
ELSE "View"
END

--> Name the calculated field "Test Accounts" (or at least give it a descriptive name so that you know what the field is). For all 
questions, place this calculated field in the Filters card and select only View.

Question 1
Make sure you are using the appropriate variables to address this question.

#Tableau
Column: Rank by DogID
Rows: CNT(Number of records)
Filters: Test Accounts: View
Markdown: [Color: Subcategory Name]

# Analysis
--> The tallest four bars, in other words, highest record counts, are mostly orange, the color assigned by Tableau for the Empathy 
subcategory. There is still a little of orange in the 5th bar, but compared to the first 4 bars, it is marginal, indicating a large 
decrease in the Empathy subcategory in terms of counts of records. Indeed, if look at the big picture and examine each color from where 
it dominates the bars to where you have to look hard to see it (where a subcategory has a huge decrease in number of records) and 
compare the difference in Counts of Number of Records when you can easily see the color and when you have to look hard to find it, 
the difference in the orange color is the biggest, indicating that the largest drop-off occurs in the subcategory represented by the 
orange color. That's Empathy.

--> That graph shows that for those dogs that did not complete the 20 questions of the Assessment, most of them dropped off after they 
completed the Empathy subcategory. So, what do you think the answer to Q1 is? True or False. It should be easy to tell by now.

Question 2
It might help to color-code your graph for “Test Name.”
--> Each color now represents a test name. Using the same approach as in Q1 and each color from where it almost dominates the whole bar 
to where it is barely visible and compare the difference in Counts of Number of Records. You should find that the largest difference is
in the dark green color, the 4th bar that represents the Eye Contact game. Point your cursor to the 5th bar and carefully examine 
each color. There is no dark green at all.

Question 3
It might help to color-code your graph for “Test Name.”
--> Examine the graph for Q2. Point your cursor at the first bar and count the number of different colors in that bar. 
There are at least 4 different colors, meaning there are at least this many different sequences of tests were administered to 
the customers after the test accounts are taken out.

Question 4
Please check whether you are examining the correct variables or applying an inappropriate aggregation.

Question 5
Please see Lesson 5 Dashboards and Story Points to review how to use date fields in Tableau. 
Pay close attention to the consequences of treating dates as dimensions or measures.

--> Place Created At in Columns and Number of Records in Rows. As for the previous questions, place Test Account in Filters and select 
only View (please my explanation for Q1.)
--> Click on the Created At pill and choose Month (the second one that has the example "May 2015" next to it)

# Tableau
Column: Month(Correc...)
Rows: CNT(Number of Records)
Filters: Test Accounts View
--> Point your cursor to the highest point of the graph and you should see the month Q5 is asking for.

Question 6
Please see Practice Exercise 2 of this week to review how to use Tableau to answer this question.
--> For Q6, download the other Excel file "dognition_data_no_aggregation_with_zip_code_correction" from the course website. Follow the 
instructions on pages 3 and 4 of the PDF file Week 3 Practice Exercise to upload the file to Tableau. Create a calculated field to 
correct the hours. If this is not done, you will have a graph that says the hour that customers mostly likely to play the games with 
their dogs is 0 (or 12:00 AM). Maybe a few people would do that, but definitely not the majority. So, the hours need to be corrected.

#Tableau
Formula: DATEADD("hour",[Diff from UTC],[Created at])
Filters: Test Accounts: view
Columns: HOUR(Corrected Created at)
Rows:CNT(Number of Records

--> I named the calculated field "Corrected Created At" (you can give it a descriptive name that lets you know what it is).
The details for how to join the two files are in the PDF file Week 3 Practice Exercise. 

--> filter out the test accounts. Put "Corrected Created At" (the calculated field just created) in Columns and Number of Records in Rows. 
Click on Corrected Created At. Going down to the first block of "Year Quarter Month Day More". Point to More and select Hour in the 
sub-menu. Click on Number of Records. Select Measure, then Count (Distinct). Point the cursor to the highest point of the graph to 
find the hour that customers are most likely to play games with their dogs. It says 19. That's 24-hour format. Subtract 12 to get the 
PM hour.

Question 7
Check that you are using the correct aggregations, and try using the table calculation techniques described in 
Week 3’s Practice Exercise 3 to arrive at your answer.

#Tableau 
Columns: Rank by DogID
Rows: CNTD(Dog ID), CNTD( Dog ID)
Filters: Test Accounts: View

--> Filter out the test accounts with Shih Tzu that weighed 190 pounds.Place two instances of Dog ID in Rows. For both instances,
right-click and choose Count (Distinct). You now have two instances of CNTD(Dog ID) in Rows and two bar charts in the work space. 
Right-click on the second CNTD(Dog ID), point your cursor at "Quick Table Calculation..." and choose "Percent of Total".

-->The bar chart at the bottom now has the percentage of dogs that completed each number of tests. To find out the percentage that 
completed 20 tests, point your cursor at the bar of bottom bar chart that represented 20.

Question 8
Check that you are using the correct aggregations, and try using the table calculation techniques described in Week 3’s Practice 
Exercise 3 to arrive at your answer.
--> Very similar to Q7, except that you need to create a group variable that separate the free-starters from the non-free-starters.

#Tableau
Columns: Free Start User
Rows: CNTD(Number of Records)
Filters: Test Accounts: View

# You may do so by using the following steps.
* Put the variable Free Start User in Columns. Change it to Dimension.
* Put Number of Records in Rows. Click - > Measure -> Count (Distinct)
* Always filter out the test accounts.
* Right-click on the bar that says one and select Group from the pop-up menu. You now have a new variable called Free Start User 
(Group) that you need for Q8.
* Please make sure that Test Account is still in the Filter card and only View is selected.

--> In your Tableau workspace, you should see these two parts side by side. However, if I upload them as one picture, you won't be able to 
see the details here.
For the purpose of Q8, you do not need to worry about the second part of the bar charts that has "Other" on top. "Other" consists of 
non-free-starters. Q8 only asks for the free-starters.
"1" means free-starters. At the bottom bar chart, in the part that has "1" on top, point your cursor to the bar for 20 and you should 
see the percentage of free starters that completed all 20 tests.

P.S.: In case you are as curious as me, on the part of the chart that has "Other" on top, at the bottom bar chart, point your cursor to 
the bar for 20 to find the percentage of non-free-starters that completed 20 tests. It seems that Cognition's marketing strategy of 
offering customers the first 4 tests for free was not as successful as Dognition had hoped.

Maybe Dognition should modify their marketing strategy. Eye Contact is the game where most dogs dropped off (see my explanation for Q2). 
Instead of giving out the first 4 tests for free, maybe Dognition should give out the 4 tests that come after they Eye Contact game for 
free to entice customers to complete more tests with their dogs.

Question 9
Try it for yourself to learn the correct answer!

#Tableau
Columns:
Rows: Dog ID, Test name
Filters: Dog ID (group), Test Accounts: view
Text: Second(Corrected Created At)

--> Keep the calculated field Test Account in the Filters card. You can ignore the Dog ID (group) variable shown here. That is a test 
variable I created to tests the RANK function that Q10, Q11 and Q12 mention. It only contains 5 dog ID's.

--> Place Corrected Created At (the calculated field created in Q6) in Text. Click on the pill. There are two blocks that have "Year 
Quarter Month Day More". Go to the first block. Select More, the select Second.

Question 10
Try it for yourself to learn the correct answer!

First of all, if you simply place the Created At variable inside the RANK function, Tableau will give you an error message at the 
bottom of the dialog box.

If you click on the triangle, you will see the details of the error message: "All fields must be aggregate or constants when using table 
calculation functions or fields from multiple data source"

After seeing the detail of this error message, you know immediately that the statement "there is nothing needed" should NOT be selected.
What about other statements?

An aggregate function is needed. You always place the function in front of the variable. So, immediately, you can eliminate two more 
statements: "an aggregation after [Created At], the most appropriate of which is MEDIAN" & "an aggregation after [Created At], the 
most appropriate of which is ATTR " These two statements say that you should place the aggregate function after Created at, which is 
wrong.

There are only two statements left. One suggests the MEDIAN function, the other suggests the ATTR function. Which one do you need if 
you are to write the RANK function? Think about what the MEDIAN function does and you will quickly conclude that MEDIAN is not the right
aggregate function to mix with RANK.

So, what statement should be chosen for Q10? After the analysis and eliminations above, there is only one possible answer left.

Question 11
Refer to Lessons 4 Table Calculations and Parameters and Lesson 5 Dashboards and 
Story Points to review the material relevant to this question.

#Tableau
Columns:
Rows: Dog ID, Test name, RANK
Filters: Dog ID (Group), Test Accounts: View
Detail: Rank
Text: Corrected Created At

The purpose of writing a calculation here is to, for each dog ID, rank the tests according to the order they were taken. For every 
dog ID, the first test taken would receive the rank 1, the second would receive the rank 2 and so on. The calculation should achieve 
the same purpose as the Ranked by Dog ID field.

Once you understand the purpose and function of the calculation, there is only "1" statement that stands out as the correct choice.
(I put 1 inside double quotations to emphasize it. Combined with the analysis above, do you get the hint?)

P.S. : You do not need to write the function, but if you like to explore like I do, you can write the function as follow:
* Rank(ATTR([Created at]),"asc")
* Make sure you specify "asc" for ascending. Otherwise, the default is descending and the last test a dog took would receive rank 1.
* Name the calculation RANK (or any descriptive name that tells what it is)

Always keep the Test Account variable in the Filters card. You can ignore the Dog ID (group) variable shown here. It is a test variable 
I created to test the RANK function and contains only 5 randomly selected Dog ID's.

Place RANK in Detail. Right-click --> Edit Table Calculation ... If you have Tableau 2019.2 (the newest version when I downloaded it), 
you would see the Table Calculation dialog box.

# Select the computing parameters as shown.
* Change RANK to Discrete. The pill should be blue now.
* Place Dog ID, Test Name and Rank in Rows in the following order.

--> As I explained in Q10, the calculation using the RANK function ranks the tests a dog took in the order from the earliest to the last.
For each dog, the first 1 receiving ranking 1.
Why don't you try it yourself?
By the way, when I wrote the calculation, I used the corrected hours. If you use the original Created At field, the hours you see on 
your table may be different, but they should not have any effect on the ranking

Question 12
Refer to Lessons 4 Table Calculations and Parameters and Lesson 5 Dashboards and Story Points to review 
the material relevant to this question, or try it yourself!

# Summary
Q12 is very similar to Q11. Q11 uses Dog ID as a partition field. The ranking starts all over at each change of Dog ID. The only 
difference between Q11 and Q12 is that while Dog ID is used in Q11, User ID should be used in Q12. Please refer to my explanation for 
Q11 for the fine details.

There is only one correct choice. With the above being said, isn't it obvious which choice is the correct one?
Following is what it looks like on Tableau. You do not have to do this for Q12. As I showed above, analysis alone suffices. However, 
I encourage you to try it out.

Keep the calculated field Test Account (see Q1 explanation) in the Filters Card. Again, you can ignore Dog ID (group). It is a variable
I created to test the RANK function. You can either place the original Created At in Text or the calculated field created in Q6. I 
used the calculated field created in Q6. The ranking will not be affected. If you use the original Created At, the hours you see will 
be different. The ranking will not be affected.

Once the calculation RANK is placed inside Rows, right-click and to double-check the following parameters are selected. I use the
2019.2 version of Tableau. If you use another version, what you see might be slightly different.

#Tableau
Columns:
Rows: User ID, Test name, RANK
Filters: Dog ID (group), Test Accounts: View
Text: Corrected Created At

Quiz 3# 
1. Use the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set provided in this course for this quiz.In the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set, 
the greatest drop offs of test-takers occur after a subcategory of tests is completed rather than while the subcategories of tests 
are still in progress. T/F

Answer: True
Comment: That graph shows that for those dogs that did not complete the 20 questions of the Assessment, most of them dropped off 
after they completed the Empathy subcategory. So, what do you think the answer to Q1 is? True or False. It should be easy to tell by 
now.


2. In the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set, after which game is the drop-off of completed tests the greatest?

Answer: 4th or 5th Bar
Comment: Each color now represents a test name. Using the same approach as in Q1 and each color from where it almost dominates the 
whole bar to where it is barely visible and compare the difference in Counts of Number of Records. You should find that the largest
difference is in the dark green color, the 4th bar that represents the Eye Contact game. Point your cursor to the 5th bar and carefully
examine each color. There is no dark green at all.So, what do you think the answer to Q2 is? Should be pretty easy

If you complete exercise 1 (Rank by DogID as a dimension and Number of records on the row shelf), just add a color filter on 
"Test Name" and look for the biggest drop in completed tests.

3. If you remove all the entries associated with Shih Tzu dogs that weigh 190 pounds from the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set, 
how many different sequences of tests were administered to customers in the data that are left?

Answer: at least 4
Comment:Examine the graph for Q2. Point your cursor at the first bar and count the number of different colors in that bar. 
There are at least 4 different colors, meaning there are at least this many different sequences of tests were administered to the 
customers after the test accounts are taken out. I think I gave you the answer on this one already.

4. During which day of the week do customers play Dognition games the most?

Answer: Sunday
Comments: set correct time column value to week. 

5. During which month in the data set were the most tests completed?
Answer: October 2014 
Comment: Point your cursor to the highest point of the graph and you should see the month Q5 is asking for.

6. After adjusting the time stamps of the tests completed by United States users provided in the “Created At” field of 
the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set for time zone differences, during which hour of the day do Dognition customers 
play the most amount of games?

Answer: 7 PM
Comment: Point the cursor to the highest point of the graph to find the hour that customers are most likely to play games with their 
dogs. It says 19. That's 24-hour format. Subtract 12 to get the PM hour.Isn't the answer to Q6 obvious now?

7.In the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set, approximately what percentage of users who begin taking the 
Dognition Assessment complete 20 tests?

Answer: 23% 
Comment:The bar chart at the bottom now has the percentage of dogs that completed each number of tests. To find out the percentage
that completed 20 tests, point your cursor at the bar of bottom bar chart that represented 20.
Isn't Q7 so easy that the credit is practically being handed to you for free?

8.In the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set, what percentage of users who begin taking the Dognition Assessment 
using a “Free Start” promotion complete 20 tests?

Answer: Either 22% or 29%
Comment:"1" means free-starters. At the bottom bar chart, in the part that has "1" on top, point your cursor to the bar for 20 
and you should see the percentage of free starters that completed all 20 tests.

9.Using the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set, if you make a table using the “Dog ID” and “Test Name” variables on the rows shelf, 
and Created At on the Text property of the Marks card, which of the following might be a value you would see in 
the column farthest to the right, if the “Created At” pill was blue and read SECOND(Created At)?

Answer: 0
Comment: The column after Test name have values of 0

10. Question 10: If you were writing a calculation to rank each test a dog completed by its time stamp in
the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set, what would be missing from the following version of your rank table 
calculation: RANK(([Created At]),'asc')

Answer: an aggregation before [Created At], the most appropriate of which is ATTR
Comments:After seeing the detail of this error message, you know immediately that the statement "there is nothing needed" should NOT be
selected.What about other statements?An aggregate function is needed. You always place the function in front of the variable. So, 
immediately, you can eliminate two more statements: "an aggregation after [Created At], the most appropriate of which is MEDIAN" & "an 
aggregation after [Created At], the most appropriate of which is ATTR " These two statements say that you should place the aggregate 
function after Created at, which is wrong.There are only two statements left. One suggests the MEDIAN function, the other suggests the 
ATTR function. Which one do you need if you are to write the RANK function? Think about what the MEDIAN function does and you will 
quickly conclude that MEDIAN is not the right aggregate function to mix with RANK.So, what statement should be chosen for Q10? 
After the analysis and eliminations above, there is only one possible answer left.

11. You are writing a calculation to rank each test a dog completed by its time stamp in the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set. 
You’ve configured your table calculation so that “Dog ID” and “Test Name” are in the Partitioning field 
and “Second Created” is in the Addressing field. The resulting rank will:

Answer: List “1” for the first test of every Dog ID
Comment:The purpose of writing a calculation here is to, for each dog ID, rank the tests according to the order they were taken. 
For every dog ID, the first test taken would receive the rank 1, the second would receive the rank 2 and so on. The calculation 
should achieve the same purpose as the Ranked by Dog ID field. Once you understand the purpose and function of the calculation, there 
is only "1" statement that stands out as the correct choice. (I put 1 inside double quotations to emphasize it. Combined with the 
analysis above, do you get the hint?)

12.You are writing a calculation to include a column in a table that ranks each test a human user completed
by its time stamp in the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set. You put this column directly to the left of the column you made 
to rank each test a dog completed by its time stamp. The following field(s) will go in the 
Partitioning field in the calculation configuration page in your new calculation meant to rank each test a human user completed: 
(check all that apply)

Answer: User ID
Comments: Q12 is very similar to Q11. Q11 uses Dog ID as a partition field. The ranking starts all over at each change of Dog ID. 
The only difference between Q11 and Q12 is that while Dog ID is used in Q11, User ID should be used in Q12. Please refer to my 
explanation for Q11 for the fine details.There is only one correct choice. With the above being said, isn't it obvious which choice 
is the correct one?
