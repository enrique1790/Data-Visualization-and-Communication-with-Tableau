### Data Analysis of Dognition 
## Coursework Facts from our data analysis 
* Customers play the most Dognition Games on Sunday's
* Customers play the most amount of games at 7pm
* The US by far has the highest amount of Dognition customers. California being the state with highest population of users is a
market of high importance that cannot be overlooked.
* Publicity did work in Oct 2014. Dognition was featured on "60 minuetes"
* The "Free Start" promotion didn't work. less thann 6% of the users finshed it
* The story behind the drop off rates reveal three trends: Occur when a subcategory test is completed rather than when a subcategory
test is still in progress.
* Empathy --> Communication --> Cunning Bar charts clearly reveal this drop off trend. 
* The drop off rate after test 20 reveals That The Complexity and Technicality of the games is so high that it discourages the users to
continue on. (But will better traning and better explained videos be enough? at some point a personal trainer will be needed.)
