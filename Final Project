# Structure of Presentation: Should last about 4-5 minuets
Have about 5 Slides:
* One Recommendation Slide
* 4-5 Data Analysis Slides
Summary:
Since the goal of this final project is to propose Business process changes. Before embarking any sort of 
data analysis  it's important to first come up with a list of recommendations first. 
Your Data Analysis Examples must at mimium support your recommendations for this project. 

### Recommendations & Smart Goal  

# Recommendation 
Outline: (suggest 3 recommendations)
* Highlight Smart Goal (Increase number of median test completed per subcriber by  10% over the next 6 months)
* Advertise to targeted cities 
* Implement Achievement such as badges to keep subcribers engaged
* Targeted Reminders (to Users at Specific Tests Where engagement drops the most)

# Smart Goal
Outline:
*Increase number of median test completed per subcriber by  10% over the next 6 months

### Data Analysis of Dognition 
## Coursework Facts from our data analysis 
* Customers play the most Dognition Games on Sunday's
* Customers play the most amount of games at 7pm
* The US by far has the highest amount of Dognition customers. California being the state with highest population of users is a
market of high importance that cannot be overlooked.
* Publicity did work in Oct 2014. Dognition was featured on "60 minuetes"
* The "Free Start" promotion didn't work. less than 6% of the users finshed it
* The story behind the drop off rates reveal three trends: Occur when a subcategory test is completed rather than when a subcategory
test is still in progress.
* Empathy --> Communication --> Cunning Bar charts clearly reveal a downward drop off trend. 
* The drop off rate after test 20 reveals That The Complexity and Technicality of the games is so high that it discourages the users to
continue on. (But will better traning and better explained videos be enough? at some point a personal trainer will be needed.)

# Analysis One: Geographical Spread of the Customer 
Outline: (Identify growth opportunities)
* Cites (top 5)
* States (top 3)
* Countries (#1 in the world)

## Summary: insights from all three
Cites: 
* Durham
* Tuscon
* Tampa
* Charlotte
* Rochester

States: 
1# California is the state with the highest population of users. 

Country: 
1# The US by far has the highest amount of Dognition customers in the world. 

# Analysis Two: User Activity Outline: 
* Sunday Customers play the most Dognition Games (prove with visualization)
* At 7pm Dognition customers play the most amount of games (prove with visualization)

Summary:
* Recommendation: Dognition could send a notification to play the next game at around 7pm

# Analysis Three: Analysis of publicity vs promotion
Outline: [increasing completion rates]
*Dognition was featured on "60 minuets" in 2014
* Free Start didn't work
Summary: 
Publicity (publicity did work) - prove with visualizaitons 
Promotion (while enrolled in the free start program less than 6% of the users finished it) - prove with visualizations

# Analysis Four: The story behind drop off rates in subcategories 
Outline: (Three drop of trends)
subcategories: 3
* Empathy ( the higest drop off rate occurs in this subcategory after the eye contact game)
* Communication
* Cunning

outcomes: 2
* Test completed
* Test still in progress

Summary: Analysis of Tests in progress vs Test Completed
* There are two outcomes: test completed and test stil in progress 
* Tests are made up of subcategories
* User subcategory Drop off rates mostly occur during the completed stage instead of in progress stage of the test.
* Drop off rate after test 20 is significant: Perhaps The Complexity and Technicality of the games following the physical reasoning game is so 
high that it discourages users to continue on.
Recommendations:
* Better training videos
* Implement Achievement to keep users engaged
* get feedback from users why they drop out eye contac game in the empathy subcategory
