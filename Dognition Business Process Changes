### Final Project
Introduction: Hello My name is Enrique Estrada, and today I will present my Recommendations and smart goal. which I believe are
necessary in order to bring about ideal business process changes for dogintion.

## Recommendation: Dognition Business Process Changes 
1) Implement Achievements: such as badges to keep subcribers engaged
2) Send out targeted Reminders: (to Users at Specific Tests Where engagement drops the most)
3) Use Social media: as alternative to the free start promotion

Recommention: 
The Recommendations proposed are intended to increase user game completion rates. To get a better picture of 
this phemonema my data analysis will explore the following: demographics, user participation, drop off rates.

Introduction: First we begin by looking at the Geographical Spread of the customer. in order to have a better idea where to focus
sales and marketing efforts. 

## Geographical Spread of the Customer
1# The US by far has the highest amount of Dognition customers in the world.
1# California is the state with the highest population of users. 

Based of this data, My strategy will Focus Marketing and Sales efforts in the regions CA, NC, NY, TX, FL.

Introduction: Now We move into analysing completion rates in order to get a better picture of what User activity looks like.  

## Completion Rates: When Users are most Active

Graph 1: Time
At 7pm Dognition customers play the most amount of games

Graph 2: Day
On Sunday Customers play the most Dognition Games

Graph 3: Month
Month in the data set were the most tests completed: October 2014
Comment:
What Happened in Octoober 2014? Dognition was featured on "60 minutes" in Oct 2014. This reveals Publicity did work to increase user 
participation levels.

* From this data, we can begin to create a strategy to use targeted reminders. Since we know when and where customers tend to play 
the games. however for the strategy to be complete we still need to explore drop off rates. To have a complete picture of user behavior
we need data that tells us the story behind low participation levels.

Introduction: Finally we will analyse graphs inorder to get insight into user behavior during the personality test. 
## Drop Off Rates: Insight to user behavior 

Graph 1: Free Start promotion was not successful
* Dognition periodically tries offering a “Free Start” promotion to customers that gives the customers the first four tests for free. 
The hypothesis (or hope) would be that once potential customers get a chance to experience the product first-hand, they will be more
likely to buy a subscription. But from the below chart we can see that Free Start users dropped more after the fourth game than No 
Free Start users. So this promotion strategy is not effective as expected.
* Therefore “Free Start” promotion can be cancelled due to lack of effectiveness. 

Graph 2: Percentage of completed Test: About 23% of their users complete 20 tests
*  There are five colors, meanings that there are five subcategories in the 20-question assessment.

Graph 3: Subcategoaries & Drop off rates: Eye Contact is the game where most dogs dropped off
* In general, there is a decrease going from one subcategory to another subcategory. This overall trend reveals that users generally 
drop after completing a subcategory. this might suggest that it's challenging for dog owners to keep their pets engaged to complete 
another subcategory, so the owner becomes discouraged from continuing on with the test. Also perhaps dogs have low attention spans
therefore might need a break before moving on to a new subcategory.

Introduction: now that we acquired better understanding behind user participation and drop off rates lets re-cap.

## Conclusion: How to increase user participation levels and improve the user experience during tests
* Recommendation: Recap
1) Implement Achievements 
*The idea here is to Create a badge system:To build a sense of accomplishment after completing a game. also encourages users to persist 
further to complete as many games as possible. Might even be a good a idea to hold tournments every once and awhile to bring users to 
compete for who has the most talented dog and who has the best personality relationship with his owner. 

2) Send out targeted Reminders 
*For reminders to be effected it's critical to send out during times where engagement drop the most specially.
(Eye Contact game which is the forth game). Also during times where users are most active such as after-work periods, and on Sundays
at 7pm.

3) Use Social media as alternative to the free start promotion.
*Free start was not effective I propose the Dognition team instead Post actively on Instagram, and Facebook content with interesting
tips, facts, or some cute  pictures of dogs. Specially during the following days: Friday through Monday

This concludes my recommendations for dognition. Thank you for watching.
