### Final Project

## Recommendation: Dognition Business Process Changes 
1) Implement Achievement such as badges to keep subcribers engaged
2) Send out targeted Reminders (to Users at Specific Tests Where engagement drops the most)
3) Use Social media and online advertisements as alternative to the free start promotion

Recommention 
The Recommendations proposed are intended to reduce user drop off rates and increase completion rates. To get a better picture of 
this phemonema my data analysis will explore the following: demographics, user participation, drop off rates.

## Geographical Spread of the Customer
Focus Marketing and Sales efforts:
1# The US by far has the highest amount of Dognition customers in the world.
1# California is the state with the highest population of users. 
Top 3 Cities: 

Comment: Focus Marketing and Sales efforts in the following regions proposed aboved.

## Completion Rates: When Users are most Active

Graph 1: Time
At 7pm Dognition customers play the most amount of games

Graph 2: Day
On Sunday Customers play the most Dognition Games

Graph 3: Month
Month in the data set were the most tests completed: October 2014
Comment:
What Happened in Octoober 2014? Dognition was featured on "60 minutes" in Oct 2014. This reveals Publicity did work to increase user 
participation levels.

Strategy: Use targeted reminders

Comment:
Dognition may use reminder emails and online advertisement as alternative promotion strategies. In order to better target customers,
we need to look at when and where customers tend to play the games. Obviously from the charts, most users play the games during the 
beginning of a week and during the after-work period (05:00pm-20:00pm); Users are mainly located in United States and from California,
North Carolina and New York, Texas and Florida.

## Drop Off Rates: Insight to user behavior 

Graph 1: Free Start promotion was not successful
Dognition periodically tries offering a “Free Start” promotion to customers that gives the customers the first four tests for free. 
The hypothesis (or hope) would be that once potential customers get a chance to experience the product first-hand, they will be more
likely to buy a subscription. But from the below chart we can see that Free Start users dropped more after the fourth game than No 
Free Start users. So this promotion strategy is not effective as expected.

Conclusion:
“Free Start” promotion can be cancelled due to lack of effectiveness.
