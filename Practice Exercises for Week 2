## Practice Exercises for Week 2

**Excercise 1**
Columns:
Rows: Sign in Count
Filters: Dog ID (Group): Other "Other box is checked off"
DetaiL: Dog ID
Color: Dog ID (group)

1) How many unique dogs are in the dataset (Indicated by the number of unique entires in Dog ID)?
2) How many unique (human) users are in the dataset (indicated by the numgber of unique entries in User ID)?

## Comments:
Dog IDs with Sign in Count of above 175 are grouped and filtered out to exclude these outliers.

### Notes:
I was able to get around this issue by putting sign in count on rows, Dog ID on detail, 
and then right clicking on the axis --> edit axis --> fixed --> select 0 - 175.
once the axis is restricted then I manually drag selected (hold left click) data and made a group. 
Then i could put this dog id group in the filter card and it works.

**Excercise 2**
Columns:Breed Type
Rows: Breed Type Median(Total Tests Complete)
Filters: Dog ID (Group) : Other; Breed Type Select [Cross Breed, Mixed Breed/Other, Popular Hybrid, Pure Breed]
## Comments:
Median Total Tests Completed for all Breed Types is 7. Is this correct?

**Excercise 3**
Columns: Breed Group
Rows: MEDIAN(Total Test Complete), CNTD(Dog ID)
Filters: Dog ID (Group): Other, Breed Group [Herding, Hound, Non-Sporting, Sporting, Terrier, Toy, Working], Dog ID [Other)

## Comments:
This bar chart shows the median Total Tests Completed for DNA Tested broken down by Dog Fixed.
The median Total Tests Completed is highest for dogs which are DNA tested but not spayed/neutered, 
which supports the hypothesis that owners which intend to breed their digs may be more interested 
in the personality of their dogs than other owners.

**Excercise 4**
Columns: Country
Rows: MEDIAN(Total Tets Complete) CNTD(Dog ID)
Filters: Dog ID(group): Other [select other], CNTD(Dog ID)[ 30, 10,262], Country [AU, CA, DE, DK, FR, GB, NO, NZ, US]
Color: Country

## Comments:
The charts show the median of Total Tests Completed and distinct count of Dog ID for each Country. 
The distinct count of Dog ID filter includes values greater than or equal to 30. 
Out of these countries, Germany, Denmark, Norway and New Zealand have higher median Total Tests Completed than the US.


**Excercise 5**
Columns: Total Tests Completed
Rows: Mean ITI(minutes) MedianITI(minutes)
Filters: Dog ID(group)[Other checked off]: Other, Total Tests Completed [1,19], Mean ITI(minutes)

## Comments:
The trend lines or Mean ITI and Median ITI go in opposite directions.
The median is less affected by outliers, the Median ITI trend line supports the hypothesis that 
customers who complete tests more quickly are more likely to complete more tests.
