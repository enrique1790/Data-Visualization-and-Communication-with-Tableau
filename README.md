### Four Styles of Analytics 
1. Descriptive analytics : Which answers the questions what happens or what is happening. (Bar graphs, Pie charts, etc)
2. Diagnostic analytics: Why things are happening? looking more for root cases.(Fraud detection)
3. Predictive analytics: What is going to happen? looking more at a trajectory of understanding why things are happening, and what is happening to develop that trajectory of the likely scenarios in the future. (Regression & predictive models)
4. Prescriptive analytics: The system is actually giving a recommendations. (Machine learning, Big Data Techniques, etc)

### Why don't more companies move up higher on the continuum? 
*Advance analytic solutions tend to be plagued by a lack of experience.*

### What should a data anlyst do if the best way to solve the business problem is to use a type of data analysis that is higher up in the continuum than the company culture is used to?
*You could suggest forming two separate data analysis teams one for traditional business analytics the company is used to, and another for newer analyics that don't yet fit into the company's culture. The teams would function under different rules. Pay attention to what kinds of analytics tool and results they are willing to work with.*
